# Satellite-Image-Segmentation
This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for satellite image segmentation and object extraction from noisy images. The project evaluates multiple segmentation techniques, including K-Means, Mean Shift, and Graph-Based segmentation, followed by region-growing algorithms and connected component analysis (CCA) for refinement.
